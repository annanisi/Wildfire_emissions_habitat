Code for: "Alignment between wildfire vulnerability, carbon emissions, and wildlife habitat quality across the wildland-urban interface"
Authors: Anna C. Nisi, Adam Millard-Ball, Kai Zhu, Miriam Greenberg, Christopher C. Wilmers

Scripts: 
* sample_point_data.R: Creates point datasets that sample the study area and extracts spatial covariates at point locations (household carbon footprint, land use type, puma habitat metrics).
* analysis.R: Tests how household carbon footprint and habitat metrics vary across land use categories (sparseley developed, wildland-urban intermix and interface, and urban areas), tests how the risk of a building being within a wildfire perimeter varies across land use types, and quantifies how household carbon footrpint, puma habitat metrics, and wildfire risk vary across household density at the census block group level. 
* study_area_maps.R: Makes maps of spatial data considered in this analysis.
